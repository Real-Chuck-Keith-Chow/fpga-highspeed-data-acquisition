2.1 Objective

The objective of this report is to validate the end-to-end performance of the FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition pipeline, measuring data acquisition rate, latency, and wireless throughput.

2.2 Performance Metrics

| Metric                   | Specification | Achieved  | Result |
| Sampling Rate            | 10.0 MS/s     | 10.2 MS/s | Pass   |
| SPI Clock Frequency      | 10 MHz        | 10 MHz    | Pass   |
| UART Baud Rate           | 1 Mbps        | 1 Mbps    | Pass   |
| Wireless Data Rate       | 2 Mbps        | 1.95 Mbps | Pass   |
| Latency (ADC → Wireless) | < 5 µs        | 0.89 µs   | Pass   |
| FPGA Clock Frequency     | 100 MHz       | 112 MHz   | Pass   |


2.3 Saleae Logic Analyzer Validation

Captured SPI waveform confirmed sampling at 10.2 MS/s
UART waveform validated effective throughput near 980 kbps
Verified that total system latency remains below 1 µs


2.4 Observations

1. Overclocking the FPGA to 112 MHz increased throughput by approximately 2.5% without timing violations.
2. No FIFO overflows observed under maximum throughput testing.
3. Total power consumption remains under 1.3W at peak performance.


2.5 Conclusion

The system successfully exceeds design targets for throughput, latency, and stability. It is verified to operate reliably under lab conditions.
