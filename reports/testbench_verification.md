3. Testbench Verification Report

Testbench Verification Report

System: FPGA-Based High-Speed Data Acquisition
Test Environment: QuestaSim 2023.2 + Python Automation
Author: Chuck Chow


3.1 Objective

The purpose of this report is to verify functional correctness across all Verilog modules, validate pipeline integrity, and ensure that the FPGA system reliably acquires, processes, and transmits data.


3.2 Test Setup

Simulator: QuestaSim, Icarus Verilog
Python Automation:`generate_test_report.py` + `process_uart_byte.py`
Logic Analysis Tool: Saleae Logic Analyzer

Command for Simulation:
bash
iverilog -o sim -I src/ tb/tb_data_acquisition_system.v src/*.v
vvp sim | python scripts/process_uart_byte.py
