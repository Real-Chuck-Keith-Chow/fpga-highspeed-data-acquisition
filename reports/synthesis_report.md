 FPGA Synthesis Report

Project: High-Speed Data Acquisition System
Platform: Xilinx Artix-7 (XC7A100T-CSG324)
Tool: Vivado 2023.1
Author: Chuck Chow

1.1 Overview

This project implements a high-speed data acquisition system capable of sampling at 10 MS/s using the Texas Instruments ADS8881 ADC. The ADC interfaces with the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA over an SPI bus, processes the data in real-time, and transmits it wirelessly via the nRF24L01+ module.
